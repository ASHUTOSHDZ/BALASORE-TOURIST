    <h3>about chandipur-</h3>
    <br>
    <p> <h3> Chandipur, is a beach in Balasore District, Odisha, India. The beach is located on the shore of Bay of Bengal and is approximately 16 kilometers from the Balasore Railway Station. The beach is unique in a way that the water recedes up to 5 kilometers during the ebb tide.  In the state of Odisha, near Balasore Village in the small town of Chandipur, Chandipur Beach is a secluded place shrouded in mystery. It's unique because the sea water periodically disappears right in front of your eyes, then reappears after some time.</h3></p>
